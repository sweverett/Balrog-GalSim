# Mostly stolen from Niall's galsim_extra.focal_plane class


# This example config file uses a number of the custom modules available in galsim_extra including
#     FocalPlane output type
#     MixedScene stamp type
#     CosmosR50, CosmosFlux value types along with cosmos_sampler input type
#     LogNormal value type
#     OffChip value type
modules:
    - galsim_extra
    - injector

# via either the YAML tag (e.g. *run) or in an eval string (e.g. '$run').
eval_variables:

    srun: &run "001"

    # These make it easier to include the right value in the truth catalog.

# We have several different kinds of objects that we draw.
#
# "Bright" galaxy models are bulge + disk + knots of star formation
#
# This follows the model used in Sheldon & Huff 2017
#
# The knots are just point sources, distributed according to
# a random walk
#
# All components have the same r50
#
# The bulge and disk have independent ellipticities
# The bulge has g1,g2 scatter of 0.1 (0.2 in eta)
# The disk  has g1,g2 scatter of 0.2 (0.4 in eta)
#
# The knots have the same ellip as the disk
#
# The bulge fraction is random, drawn from [0,1]
# The fraction of the light in the disk is further
# divided between the smooth component and the knots,
# also drawn as a fraction between [0,1]
#
# The scale radius and flux are drawn jointly from the
# COSMOS 25.2 limited sample
